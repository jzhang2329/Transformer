# Transformer

This model is designed to translate German to English. The model consists of an encoder, a decoder, and an attention mechanism.

For data, only one sentence was used during the training of the model since data isn't important at this moment, and there is also a lack of a dataset.

Therefore, that sentence was also used in testing.
